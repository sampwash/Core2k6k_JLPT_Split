It is suggested that you practice writing on a notebook while studying this deck. This will improve your writing skills tremendously. Also, try to pronounce the word with correct pitch accent to learn natural accent from ground up, this shall prove to be very useful when you continue to learn.

If you are a **new japanese learner** that wants a source to learn vocabulary, this is deffinately for you. Before you start studying, I suggest that you learn the following concepts before starting:

* What is japanese pitch accent?
* How to read hiragana?
* Why is kanji stroke order so important?

After all that, go ahead and download anki and set it up. From there, all you need to do is download the files from [Releases Tab](https://github.com/sampwash/Core2k6k_JLPT_Split/releases/latest). Then import the deck from "File > Import".
